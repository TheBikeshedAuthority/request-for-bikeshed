           Introduction of Request For Bikeshed (RFB) Series

Abstract

   Because of the inevitable debate of trivial items at the Hacklab
   hacker space, it is clear that a standard, agreed-upon protocol for
   bickering over policy is established. Ironically, the agreement of
   such a standard may, itself, be subject to being "bikeshedded". The
   preemptive drafting of this document aims to mitigate such a
   recursive problem.

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies a horrible, non-efficient, policy-setting
   protocol for the Hacklab community, and requests discussion and
   suggestions for improvements ("bikeshedding"). Distribution of this
   memo is unlimited.

RFB 1                  Introduction of RFB Series            1 June 2012


1  Introduction

   The Request For Bikeshed series is a precise, verbose, and a serious
   joke for members within the Hacklab community. The Bikeshed
   Authority, an authority of which is in a constant state of colour-
   based flux, is responsible for the maintenance of the RFB series.

1.1  Terminology

   Bikeshedding            Defined as democracy in action or an exercise
                           in futility.

   Dropped Issue           The state of a dispute when the original 
                           parties can no longer decide what colour of
                           paint to use.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Document Definition

   An RFB document is broken down into four, distinct, and REQUIRED
   sections outline below.

2.1  Front Page

   An overly verbose front-page that MAY contain a wordy introduction to
   the disputed matter.

   The required sections are the Abstract, Status of this Memo,
   Copyright Notice, and Table of Contents.

   The abstract is an attempt to convey the subjective issue to the
   layperson, single handedly demonstrating the hilarity and
   insignificance of the dispute. As a result, the abstract should
   render the rest of the RFB unnecessary.

   The memo status summarizes to whom this document is for.

   The copyright notice is REQUIRED as The Bikeshed Authority is
   insanely jealous and wants credit for everything it may possibly have
   a hand in; Then rub your nose in it.

RFB 1                  Introduction of RFB Series            1 June 2012


2.2  Grievances

   The section is comprised of everyone's supposed grievances. The body
   MAY be an entire waste of your time to read and involves waxed
   poetics of everyone's opinion.

2.3  Proposed Solutions

   This section is considered the most dangerous for perpetuating a
   "bikeshedded" topic. Members within the Hacklab community propose
   solutions that either are in direct violation of a previous RFB or
   spur off an endless cycle of comments, eventually causing all
   original parties to "drop" the issue.

2.4  RFB Responses

   An RFB MAY be written to respond to an existing RFB, increasing the
   "bikeshedding" factor of the RFB series.


3  RFB Archive

   The RFB series is considered an archived series. All Request For
   Bikeshed memos will be saved permanently by The Bikeshed Authority on
   its GitHub account:

      https://www.github.com/TheBikeshedAuthority/request-for-bikeshed

   A member of the Hacklab community, upon writing a valid RFB, MUST
   make a Pull Request to The Bikeshed Authority to include the RFB into
   the archive. The Bikeshed Authority will review the proposed RFB and
   MAY publish it using its sole discretion.

4  Closing Remarks

   The Bikeshed Authority invites all members within the Hacklab
   community to respond to this RFB using the RFB format, and to open
   all grievances using the new RFB protocol.

   This RFB was drafted using NroffEdit, and The Bikeshed Authority
   encourages writers to use this software to keep them from pulling
   their hair out when conforming to the formatting standards for RFB.

   Good hunting.
