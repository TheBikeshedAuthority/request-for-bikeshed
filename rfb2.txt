                 Addition of Coaxially-based Intertubes

Abstract

   Because of the poor performance of the existing Digital Subscriber
   Line (DSL) intertube connectivity at the lab, it is clear that an
   alternative solution is required. This proposed solution involves
   introducing coaxially-based intertubes to the lab.

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies a potential solution to the problems with the
   lab intertubes. This solution has been proven at Fumon's house down
   the street. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

RFB 2            Addition of Coaxially-based Intertubes     23 June 2013


0. TL;DR

   I want to add a cable internet connection at the lab, to improve
   reliability and speed for the lab's users. It SHALL NOT be the
   primary connection for now, but would be selectable if you want to
   use it. If it works well we MAY propose switching it to be the
   primary connection in a later RFB.

1  Introduction

   The performance and reliability of the intertubes at the lab have
   been unacceptable for some time. We are paying for 10Mbps, but get
   6Mbps at best, and much of the time lately get 1Mbps instead. Our
   upstream is 768k, which is too low. Attempts to troubleshoot this
   with the providers leads to the pointing of fingers, and often the
   problem resolving itself only to show up again later.

   Since the telephone-based tubes in the Kensington Market area are not
   in good enough condition for high performance DSL, we are proposing
   coaxially-based intertubes be installed and activated.

1.1  Terminology

   Coaxial cable           Also known as coax, is a type of cable
                           that has an inner conductor surrounded by a
                           tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a
                           tubular conducting shield.

   DHCP Client-ID          As specified in RFC 2131 [RFC2131], a field
                           that clients can set which the DHCP server
                           can use to determine what parameters to
                           provide to that client.

   DSL                     Digital Subscriber Line, a technology that
                           allows members of the HackLab to digitally
                           subscribe to "lines" of content, similar to
                           the way in which RSS functions other than
                           not being the same at all.

   Intertubes              The tubes that carry packets to/from the lab.

   Ostrich                 A flightless swift-running African bird
                           (Struthio camelus, family Struthionidae) with
                           a long neck, long legs, and two toes on each
                           foot.

RFB 2            Addition of Coaxially-based Intertubes     23 June 2013


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Problem Definition

   The intertubes at the lab are frequently clogged, and sometimes
   packets leak out. This leads to the situation where one MUST tether
   to one's cellular telephone to get reasonable packet flow rates. The
   author has avoided the lab at some points and gone home instead at
   times when large files MUST be downloaded.

2.1  Proposed Solutions

   We are proposing installing a Rogers Business cable connection
   alongside the existing DSL. Using a special DHCP Client ID (as
   specified in RFC 2131 [RFC2131]) would cause your traffic to be
   routed out this new connection instead by giving you a different
   default gateway. This would allow both wired and wireless users to
   access either connection. If this works well, a future RFB MAY
   propose switching the cable to be the primary connection.

2.2  Grievances

   Much of the lab dislikes Rogers for various reasons. Their Business
   side seems to be better, from the author's dealings with them. The
   proposed plan SHALL NOT include a contract, so we could terminate at
   any time if this becomes problematic.

2.3  Financial Aspects

   The proposed package is $80/month in Canadian Dollars. This SHALL NOT
   involve a contract, so if the membership decides this is not working
   out we MAY terminate at any time. This package provides 30Mbps down
   and 5Mbps up, which is a 5-fold improvement over the best we get
   currently.

2.4  Personnel Aspects

   The Operations Team at the lab would arrange for the installation of
   the coaxially-based intertubes, and set up the router to allow for
   the use of such.

3  RFB Response Submission

   An RFB MAY be written to respond to this RFB. This action MUST take
   place before the BED of this RFB.
