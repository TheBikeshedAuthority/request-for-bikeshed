                 Obliteration Of Hacklab Bar And Column
                                  RFB 3

Abstract

   Due to the current space constraints of the Hacklab Toronto Club Inc.
   location at 170a Baldwin Street Toronto, small modifications to the
   space can greatly improve the usefulness of the facility.  The
   author proposes a space modification which involves the removal of
   the divider ("bar") and column ("column") which partially bisect the
   Southern half of the Hacklab.  Removal of the bar and column will
   open up the space and may facilitate new and interesting uses of the
   Hacklab.  This proposal includes the hiring of a handy-person and
   licensed electrician to comply with electrical codes.



Status of this Memo

   This memo describes a method for creating more space at the lab.
   Distribution is unlimited.

RFB 3            Obliteration Of Hacklab Bar And Column        July 2014


0.  TL:DR

   We can have Homepro (handy-people/licensed electricians) remove,
   dispose of and rewire the bar/column for a total before-tax cost of
   $500.  This would open the space up.


1.  Introduction

   The Hacklab is a relatively small space, consisting of roughly 630
   square feet in the South, upper unit of 170 Baldwin Street, Toronto.
   The unit consists of a kitchen, washroom, and a large living area
   partially bisected by a ~4 foot tall wall with a tabletop, which the
   lab generally refers to as "the bar".  The bar is terminated by a
   column which reaches floor to ceiling.

   The bisection of the living space might once have served a purpose
   but has worn out its usefulness.  The space can become quite crowded
   during open house night, and the layout necessitates that individuals
   occupy the standing room between the bar and the stairs, which makes
   it difficult for other individuals to move freely between the kitchen
   or washroom and the front of the lab.  The bar often attracts garbage
   and unwanted electronics.  The bar breaks up the space which also
   makes it difficult to hold large workshops at the Hacklab.

   The author proposes a solution wherein the Hacklab hires a renovation
   company called Homepro to remove the bar and the column.  Homepro
   would dispose of the resulting garbage and would re-route the
   electrical wiring that currently runs through the bar and column in a
   way that complies with electrical codes.


1.1.  Terminology

   Bar:  The roughly 4 foot tall, 7 foot long section of wall that
      partially bisects the southern half of the Hacklab.  The "Bar" is
      made out of metal studs, drywall and a prefabricated counter-top
      likely coated in melamine or a similar substance.  The bar
      contains BX-style electrical wiring.

   Column:  The floor-to-ceiling square column which terminates the free
      end of the Bar. The Column is made of drywall and either a metal
      or wooden support structure.  BX-style electrical wiring runs
      inside the column.

   HomePro:  A professional, relatively low-priced home renovation
      outfit which has already given Hacklab a quote on the work to be
      completed.  They would help remove the Bar and Column and would
      re-route the electrical wiring which currently runs inside of the
      Bar and Column.  Their electrician is licensed.

   Beer:  A high-quality beverage which could theoretically be consumed
      while hacklab members happily destroy the bar as a community-
      building exercise.


2.  Problem Definition

   The Bar and the Column obstruct our use of the space.  They need to
   go.


3.  Proposed Solutions

   Hacklab hires Homepro to help remove and dispose of the Bar and
   Column.  Homepro then reworks the existing electrical so that the lab
   may continue to plug in endless numbers of wall-wart USB charging
   devices.  Hacklab would be responsible for any touch-ups to the
   floor, ceiling and wall.  Hacklab may leave this in an unfinished
   state, but we would be wise to commit to some DIY touch-ups.  The
   Hacklab Board has already sought and obtained permission from our
   landlady Pearl to perform this work.  She likes us quite a bit as
   tenants and this solution is partly based on her suggestions.


4.  Quote

   The Hacklab invited a representative from Homepro to survey the
   space.  They are willing to perform the above-mentioned work for a
   before-tax price of $500. $200 of this is removal and disposal of the
   Bar/Column, and $300 is the electrical reworking.  The Board Of
   Directors has an electronic copy of a quoation from Homepro which
   outlines this pricing, and also goes on to say that their work will
   comply with all building and electrical codes, and that the work is
   warrantied against defects for 2 years after completion.


5.  Grievances

   The HackTouch is currently mounted on the column, and we would need
   to find a place to put it if the Column were to be removed.  The bar
   supports a number of devices, including the computer which runs the
   HackTouch and various multimedia devices which are notoriously
   difficult to use.  The bar is also used as storage for things which
   the lab does not need or want but is too indecisive to get rid of.
   All of these things would have to be relocated if we chose to remove
   the Bar and Column.  The Hacklab Nap Couch also backs against the
   Bar, and would need to be relocated or disposed of, significantly
   reducing the number of Sunday Afternoon Naps which occur at the lab.
   Some individuals may have concerns that we will spend the money and
   then move to another space, though it should be pointed out that we
   have been on the brink of moving for more than a year and may not
   move for some time.  Finally, there would be fewer surfaces to put
   your laptop on during a Tuesday Night, which may be a problem for
   individuals making heavy use of the Tower Of Fabrication on Tuesdays.

6.  Financial Considerations

   $500 plus tax is a large sum of money, however Hacklab is able to pay
   this out of pocket easily.  Hacklab has roughly 50 members, which
   means that we are paying roughly $10 per member for improvement of
   the space.  The author finds it highly likely that each member will
   derive greater than $10 worth of added value from their Hacklab
   membership as a result of this work being completed.  Assuming this
   is correct, the author believes this is a sound financial decision
   with the potential to bring more value to the space.



7.  RFB Responses

   All individuals wishing to bikeshed this action MUST submit a pull
   request to The Bikeshed Authority as per RFB1, for inclusion of their
   response RFB into the RFB3 series.  This must be done before the BED.


8.  BED

   The Bikeshed Expiration Date (BED) of this document is July 31, at
   which time the issue is put to BED and action MAY be taken.


9.  Closing Remarks

   This makes sense for the lab.  It will give us more space to work
   with.  This is a thing we can do almost immediately to improve the
   current space.
